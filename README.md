# PROJECT-BEEBOT

## Introduction
In large scale warehouses and sensitive and intoxicated laboratory environments, transporting 
goods and equipment between distant locations that requires human effort and time. This can 
lead to inefficiencies and safety risks. Project Beebot addresses this issue by introducing an 
autonomous robotic navigation system designed specifically to address these issues along 
predefined routes within such environments. 

## Objective 
To develop a cost-effective, LiDAR- and IMU-free robotic system that enables autonomous 
movement in structured indoor spaces.
